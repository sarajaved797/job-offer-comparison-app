# 🎯 Job Offer Comparison App (Early MVP)

This interactive Streamlit app helps job seekers make **data-driven decisions** when comparing multiple job offers based on factors that actually matter — not just salary.

## 🚀 What It Does
- Compare two or more job offers based on:

  - Flexibility (remote/on-site/hybrid)

  - Base salary, bonuses, and benefits

  - 401(k), relocation, and promotion path

  - Work culture and micromanagement

  - Career stage (fresher/switcher/etc.)

  - Decision deadlines and branding

- Assign importance (weights) to each factor

- See which offer scores better — instantly!

- Export your decision to CSV

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Job decisions are overwhelming and personal. I wanted to create a tool that helps simplify the process — with transparency and logic, not gut feeling alone.

This is an **early MVP** — focused on core functionality with pleasant visuals. More features (charts, AI, user login, etc.) will come in future iterations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python + Streamlit

- Emojis for better UX (because job search is already boring 😅)

- Export via `pandas`

## 📦 How to Run
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
